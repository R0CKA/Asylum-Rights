    <h1>Who are asylum seekers?</h1>
    <p id="info">
        An asylum seeker is a person who has fled their own country and
        applied for refugee status in another. Asylum seekers are granted
        refugee status and allowed to live in the country if they are unable or
        unwilling to return to their home country due to a well-rounded fear
        of being prosecuted because of their:

    <ul>
        <li>Race</li>
        <li>Religion</li>
        <li>Nationality</li>
        <li>Membership of a particular social group</li>
        <li>Political opinion</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <p id="info">
        Seeking asylum is a human right, and Australia has pledged to give
        asylum seekers the same human rights given to its people. Australia
        simply doesn’t do this.
    </p>
    
    <h1>How Australia Violates Human Rights:</h1>
    
    <p id="info">
        The following paragraphs about the 1951 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Refugees are from the website of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees:
    </p>
        
    <p id="convention">
        Liberty is a fundamental human right, like asylum. As a general rule, detention of asylum-
        seekers is not acceptable. It is particularly undesirable when those detained include the very
        vulnerable — children, single women, and people with special medical or psychological
        needs, such as torture victims. They are not criminals; they have already suffered great
        hardship and jailing them is wrong.
        <br/><br/>
        The 1951 Convention specifically bars countries from punishing people who have arrived
        directly from a country of persecution (or from another country where protection could not be
        assured), provided that they present themselves speedily to the authorities and show good
        cause for their illegal entry. Monitoring (through reporting obligations or guarantor
        requirements) is often a perfectly viable alternative to imprisoning asylum-seekers.
        Detention is only acceptable if it is brief, absolutely necessary, and instituted after other
        options have been implemented. Acceptable purposes include to verify identity; to determine
        the elements on which the claim for asylum is based; the protection of public order; or, if
        necessary, in cases where refugees have destroyed documents or used fraudulent ones.
        <br/><br/>
        Detained asylum-seekers should always be informed of their rights – including the right to
        challenge their imprisonment. All asylum-seekers must maintain the possibility of contacting
        the local UNHCR office, other agencies, and a lawyer.
    </p>
        
    <h1>The Australian government policy violates the above convention in the following ways:</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li>It is applied without discrimination to all unauthorised refugees including, children, single women and torture victims.</li>
        
        <li>It is neither brief or necessary. Detention of refugees can last for weeks months or even years while their application makes
        its way through the bureaucracy. Australia is the only country
        in the developed world to imprison refugees. In other
        countries, they are generally released into the community
        while their application is being processed.</li>
        
        <li>Refugees in detention centres are not informed of their
        rights to the UNHCR, refugee support groups or legal
        representatives. In fact, the Government has gone to
extraordinary lengths to isolate them from such groups.</li>
